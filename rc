# Postfix uses the envelope sender to determine which from
# `sasl_auth_map' to use.  We have to use the correct login
# because if it's different than the body's internal `from'
# address, Gmail rewrites return-path to be the canonical
# login account, which causes a mismatch and we get flagged
# as spam at a lot of places.  Mutt will set the envelope
# sender if told to, and if the address isn't specified, it
# will be taken from the `from' header internal to the
# message.  Note that the problem now becomes how to track
# sent mail items from the account they didn't go through,
# because these are not forwarded; only incoming mail is.
